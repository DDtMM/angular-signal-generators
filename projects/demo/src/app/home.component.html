<h1>Angular Signal Generators</h1>
<p>
  Angular Signal Generators is a library to help expand the usefulness of signals.
  Primarily this is done by exposing purpose built signals meant to simplify common tasks encountered in Components.
  They work like vanilla signals, but they have extra capabilities built in to help extend a signal's functionality.
  Most can be either used in a similar fashion to a writable signal, or be passed a reference to an existing signal to generate new values.

  You can install these from npm
  <code>
    npm install &#64;ddtmm/angular-signal-generators
  </code>
