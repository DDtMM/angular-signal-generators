<h1>Angular Signal Generators</h1>
<p>
  Angular Signal Generators are purpose built signals meant to simplify common tasks encountered in Components.
  They work like vanilla signals, but they have extra capabilities built in to help accomplish specific tasks.
</p>
<p>
  You can install these from npm
  <code>
    npm install @ddtmm/angular-signal-generators
  </code>
</p>
